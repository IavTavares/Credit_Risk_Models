# Credit_Risk_Models with MLFlow

So far, I've used the following Models:
+ Logistic Regression (Baseline model)
+ Random Forests + Auto Tuning (Optuna)

I've just added MLFlow code to track Logistic Regression runs.
Hopefully soon, I'll build a docker container able to serve the MLFlow app with results and with persistant storage.
